# Mechanical Admin

Mechanical Admin is a light weight computer administration tool, designed to manage Windows computers in public computer labs.

## Overview

The system includes a client which is a Windows service that runs in the background. The server is cross-platform and communicates with the computer clients and organizes them into collections. The server also hosts a web admin interface which uses websockets for realtime two-way communication. **This project is young and indev, and currently is not ready for use**.

## About

Mechanical Admin is developed by David Findley (david.findley@ou.edu)

CStatus is a minimalistic computer management and monitoring system. It includes a client which is installed on the computers to be managed, and a server which communicates with the computer clients as well as web clients through the management interface. The primary goal is to provide real time information about the power state of the client and if it is currently in use. In the future it may include a job system that would allow administrators to run tasks on collections of client computers.
