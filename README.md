# Mechanical Admin

Mechanical Admin is a light weight computer administration tool, designed to manage Windows computers in public computer labs.

## Overview

The system includes a client which is a Windows service that runs in the background. The server is cross-platform and communicates with the computer clients and organizes them into collections. The server also hosts a web admin interface which uses websockets for realtime two-way communication. **This project is young and indev, and currently is not ready for use**.
